# Web_Scraper
This is a simple python script to web scrape product reviews from e-commerce site Qoo10. 

This is implemented using Urllib (open & read URLs) and BeautifulSoup (html parsing) libraries.
Request will send from Postman with product name and it will create a csv file of reviews of that product in local.
Further can be done to insert those data in database for analysis purpose.
